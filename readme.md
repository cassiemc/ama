Go ahead, ask me anything. Anything means _anything_ - Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Design. Babies. Whatever.

I run a design studio with my best-person-ever partner in all things design, Mark. I was previously the Design Director for Mozilla Foundation. I design, write, speak, nitpick, laugh and grumble. 

I'm [@cassiemc](http://twitter.com/cassiemc) on twitter, I blogged regularly at [janeandjury.com/blog](http://www.janeandjury.com) but not so much these days. Too busy looking after people under 5 and over 69.

I co-founded [Women&&Tech](http://womenandtech.com) and [Paris Lectures](http://www.parislectures.com) and have written a bunch of things including design articles for *A List Apart*, *Smashing Magazine*, *The Pastry Box*, *Offscreen* [and more](http://www.cassiemcdaniel.com).
