I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means _anything_ - Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Design. Code. Babies. Whatever.

I am the Design Director for Mozilla Foundation. I design, write, speak, hire, nitpick, laugh and grumble. 

I'm [@cassiemc](http://twitter.com/cassiemc) on twitter, I blog at [cassiemcdaniel.com/blog](http://www.cassiemcdaniel.com/blog). 

I co-founded [Women&&Tech](http://womenandtech.com) and [Paris Lectures](http://www.parislectures.com) and have written a bunch of things including design articles for *A List Apart*, *Smashing Magazine*, *The Pastry Box*, *Offscreen* [and more](http://www.cassiemcdaniel.com).
